# Rarefaction - Is it a good idea?

Today, I came across an Editorial from the journal <i>Microbiome</i> on concepts and recommendations in microbiota studies, including data analysis. To my surprise, I found the following sentence: 

**"Rarefaction techniques are recommended to be used for specific analyses that are known to be sensitive to sequencing depth".**

Why do I say this then?
