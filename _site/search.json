    "text": "One of simpliest steps in any bioinformatics analysis is to know exactly which machine was used to sequence your samples, as well as to know in how many batchs (different runs) are your samples divided.\nIn the majority of cases, the facility or service you have used provides that information. However, in some cases - I am thinking about curation of public datasets, for example - it may be of key importance to have that information. Different machines may have different standard coverage or quality scores structured in a different fashion (thinking about the case of NOVASeq) that can greatly impact your analysis.\nAnother factor is the number of batches or sequencing runs you have on your dataset. This can have an impact in every step of your analysis - from quality control to downstream analysis. For example, if you have a batch with low sequencing depth, this can impact the quality control and filtering you may perform, as well as downstream analysis, such as differential gene expression or variant calling.\nAs you probably are aware, both of these pieces of information are available in the header of every sequence in your fastq file. For example, when exploring a fastq, the first line before every sequence will have a similar format to this one: (example taken from Wikipedia)\n@EAS139:136:FC706VJ:2:2104:15343:197393 1:Y:18:ATCACG\n\nWhere one can find the following information:\n\nEAS139: the unique instrument name\n136: the run id\nFC706VJ: the flowcell id\n2: flowcell lane\n2104: tile number within the flowcell lane\n15343: ‘x’-coordinate of the cluster within the tile\n197393: ‘y’-coordinate of the cluster within the tile\n1: the member of a pair, 1 or 2 (paired-end or mate-pair reads only)\nY: Y if the read is filtered (did not pass), N otherwise\n18: 0 when none of the control bits are on, otherwise it is an even number\nATCACG: index sequence\n\nNow, it is very complicated to go through each file and manually extract that information, especially in big datasets. That’s why we have been working on a bash script (fastq_machine_run.sh) to get the machine ID and run ID out of your fastq files. This script will go through each file, extract the machine ID (1st position) and run ID (2nd position) and print them out in a tab-formated .txt file (at the moment is called output.txt). Additionally, it will output to the terminal window a list of unique machine IDs and unique run IDs for the whole dataset - that way, you already have an idea if you need to go deep down into the output file.\nThe script is available via this link. To work with the script, you only need to give it the path to your fastq files (example -d \"fastq/\") and then the termination of the files you want to check (-t .fastq.gz). You always need to give it both arguments to the function.\nNow, you can streamline this simple, yet laborious process!!\nAndré"

    "text": "Today, I came across an Editorial from the journal Microbiome - here - on concepts and recommendations in microbiota studies, including data analysis. To my surprise, I found the following sentence:\n“Rarefaction techniques are recommended to be used for specific analyses that are known to be sensitive to sequencing depth”.\nIt is baffling to me to see this as a recommendation, considering the evidences of the problems it entails. Why do I say this?"

    "section": "What is rarefaction",
    "text": "What is rarefaction\nRarefaction is a frequent approach in microbiome studies. It consists on subsetting the samples of a study to a threshold of reads, in order to normalise the data and remove the effect of uneven sequencing depth. This is considered to be essential, since variation of sequencing depth is stochastic and can lead to biased results.\nLet M1 and M2 be two different microbiome samples. If the sequencing depth from M1 is higher than M2, then richness (an alpha-diversity metric) will be higher in M1 than in M2, even if there is no real difference between the two samples. To address this, M1 is then rarefied, or the reads of M1 are subsetted in order to create now an M1’ with the same sequencing depth as M2.\nIt seems to be a straighforward method to account for sequencing depth, so why all the fuss about it?"

    "text": "More than just meets the eye - what are the concerns with rarefaction?\nIn short, rarefaction is just throwing away good data. By doing so, we are losing information about our samples and biasing our metric estimates - if nothing else, we are getting very biased estimates on the variance. The consequences of rarefaction are very well illustrated in the amazing paper by Paul McMurdie and Susan Holmes called Waste not, want not: why rarefying microbiome data is inadmissible.\nThe authors demonstrate that rarefaction affects both diversity metrics, as well as abundance estimates.\nStarting with diversity metrics, the authors show that rarefaction leads to less accurate results in several distance metrics in comparison with other methods, ones more simple (proportion) than others (DESeq2 variance stabilization). The only one where rarefaction outperforms proportion in is the unweighted Unifrac distance. However, this is not a surprise, since unweighted unifrac, which focus on presence/absence data, is easily influencied by the sequecing depth. Nevertheless, it is also important to state this metric can also contain noise, since it cannot separate true rare lineages from noise (introduced by singletons, for example).\n\n\n\n\n\nRegarding abundance, the insult is even bigger. First of all, even with rarefaction, traditional two-group t-tests show a poor performance when comparing abundance between groups - this stems from the fact microbiome data needs robust statistical methods to deal with its nature - this topic can be left for a different post. Nevertheless, what it is shown here is that even solid statistical models, like the one implemented in DESeq2, show worst results when the samples are previously rarefied versus the raw samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor additional results and to fully understand the issues that rarefaction causes, I really recommend reading the paper from McMurdie & Holmes."

    "text": "Ok ok, rarefaction is bad. So… what should I do?\nI understand how complicated is to navigate in the literature concerning microbiome methodology, especially with so many tools, approaches and opinions. However, in my view, looking at methods that can account for differences in sequencing depth across samples, ranging from simple proportions to more complex ones, such as the variance stabilizing transformation implemented in DESeq2, is useful. Using abundance-based metrics with such approaches for beta-diversity or introducing estimates on unobserved species, as suggested here by Amy D. Willis, can yield more accurate results than rarefaction.\nRegarding abundance, several count-based models such as the ones for RNASeq - microbiome data is reads per ASV, which is the same structure as transcriptomic data - are frequently used. Other methods such as Dirichlet regressions or ANCOM II address several issues, such as sequencing depth but also the compositional nature of the data (again, a topic for a different post).\nIn any case, if you have any question, feel free to contact your local statistician (such as the Data Misfits team)!"
